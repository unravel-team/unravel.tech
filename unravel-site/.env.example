# PostHog Analytics Configuration
# Get your API key and host from https://app.posthog.com/project/settings

# PostHog API Key (required)
# Format: phc_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# PostHog Host (optional - defaults to https://app.posthog.com)
# Use this if you're self-hosting PostHog or using EU cloud
PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

# Development Notes:
# - Prefix environment variables with PUBLIC_ to make them available in client-side code
# - Never commit your actual .env file with real API keys to version control
# - PostHog will work in development mode but logs to console
